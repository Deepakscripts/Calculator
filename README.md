## Introduction

The Scientific Calculator is a web-based application designed to provide users with a comprehensive tool for performing various mathematical calculations. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this calculator offers a user-friendly interface with buttons for input and a display for output.

## Setup

To set up the Scientific Calculator on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local environment.
2. Open the project folder in your preferred code editor.
3. Ensure you have an internet connection to load Bootstrap and Font Awesome libraries.
4. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## Usage

The calculator supports basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Additionally, it provides functionality for trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan), natural logarithm (ln), logarithm (log), square root (√), and constants like π and Euler's number (e).

## Functionality

The calculator's functionality is implemented using JavaScript. It features an event listener for DOMContentLoaded to ensure the script runs after the HTML document is fully loaded. Input from the user is processed and evaluated using the `eval()` function to generate the result displayed on the screen.

## How to Use

The "How To Use" section provides detailed instructions for performing different types of calculations using the calculator. It explains step-by-step procedures for basic arithmetic operations, trigonometric functions, logarithmic functions, and using constants like π and e.
